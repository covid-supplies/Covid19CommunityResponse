<p align="center">Covid Community Response</p>
 
The Covid Community Response Team was set up in an effort to help coordinate ongoing national & local community campaigns/efforts in the fight against Covid 19.
 
Practical steps can be taken to harvest synergies on a national level resulting in a net benefit for communities on both a national and local level.
 
In practical terms, the low hanging fruit for the accrual of synergies is through standardisation of communication and the standardisations of campaigns.  This is as true for any organisation as it is for us as a community.
